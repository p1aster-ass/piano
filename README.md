# ðŸŽ¹ Piano ASM â€“ PC Speaker Piano in x86 Assembly

Welcome to **Piano ASM**, a simple musical keyboard simulator built in **x86 Assembly (TASM)**. This project uses direct hardware control to generate sound through the **PC speaker**, turning your keyboard into a minimalist piano.

## ðŸŽ¼ What It Does

Each keypress plays a different musical tone through the PC speaker.  
Itâ€™s a fun demonstration of low-level programming, real-time keyboard input, and hardware-level sound synthesis â€” no libraries, no OS sound APIs, just raw Assembly.
